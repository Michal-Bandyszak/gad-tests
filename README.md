## Project Name

**gad-tests**

## Project Description

This project is designed as a robust testing framework utilizing Playwright for end-to-end tests along with ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting. It serves as a base setup for automated testing in modern JavaScript/TypeScript environments and provides clear guidelines for code standards and project structuring.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **Playwright** - End-to-end testing framework
- **ESLint** - Static code analysis
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **@faker-js/faker** - Fake data generation for testing
- **Husky** - Git hooks management
- **dotenv** - Environment variable management


## Getting Started Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michal-bandyszak/gad-tests.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gad-tests
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Use the available scripts for various tasks such as formatting, linting, and testing.

5. Clone repository of GAD application 

   ```bash
      git clone git@github.com:jaktestowac/gad-gui-api-demo.git
   ```

## Available Scripts

- **npm run format**: Formats the codebase using Prettier.
- **npm run format:check**: Checks the code formatting.
- **npm run lint**: Lints the project using ESLint (with rules enforced to avoid warnings).
- **npm run test**: Runs end-to-end tests using Playwright.
- **npm run test:headed**: Runs tests in headed mode (useful for debugging).
- **npm run test:ui-mode**: Runs tests with UI, ideal for visual inspection during testing.
- **npm run show-report**: Displays the test report generated by Playwright.

## Project Scope

The project's scope encompasses the development of a comprehensive automated testing framework that ensures code quality and reliability. It includes:

- Automated end-to-end testing using Playwright.
- Enforced coding standards and code formatting through ESLint and Prettier.
- Integration with additional tools for data generation and environment configuration.
- Detailed documentation to guide setup, testing, and contribution efforts.
